My ANTMINER S17e produces a lot of heat. I have it running in the basement. I've tried to set it up so that it draws fresh outside air continually and vents hot air to the rest of the house and not back into its own space, but it still occasionally stops due to the PCBs reaching 80 C. I'm only going to be running this thing until the upcoming halving anyway, so I just want to do it an automatic restart whenever this happens to minimize downtime.
